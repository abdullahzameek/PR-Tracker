    by id. we get the created_at date adn then we can calculate the time taken from there.
    3) Check the title of the PR for the word Haystack, if it contains it, then we add haystack to the list of labels.
    4) the average PR size should be straightforward. When we close a PR, we will update the size in the db, along with
